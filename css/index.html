Each new environment presents a unique challenge, from Miller's ocean-covered planet that brings massive tidal waves that defy human comprehension, to the treacherous frozen world and Gargantua, the Black hole. </p>

      <h1>Fun Facts / Behind the Scenes</h1>
      <p>The black hole in Interstellar is a marvel of modern visual effects, blending scientific theory with cutting-edge technology. The collaboration between Christopher Nolan, Kip Thorne, and the visual effects team at Double Negative resulted in one of the most realistic depictions of a black hole ever created for film. The rendering process took several months and required 800 terabytes of data and countless hours of computational power. The result was a groundbreaking visual effect that not only enhanced the film but also contributed to our understanding of black holes and gravitational physics.</p>
